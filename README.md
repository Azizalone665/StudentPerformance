Student Performance Analysis - EDA Project
This project analyzes a dataset of student performance across various subjects. It includes data cleaning, normalization, outlier removal, and visual exploration using Python Libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn).

Dataset
The dataset includes:

Math score
Reading score
Writing score
Gender
Race/ethnicity
Parental level of education
Lunch
Test preparation course
Project Steps
Loading the dataset
Handling missing values (dropped unnecessary column)
Standardization of numerical features
Outlier Detection using:
IQR method
Z-score method
Exploratory Data Analysis:
Histograms
Boxplots
Scatterplots
Heatmaps
Statistical summaries (mean, median, std)
Interesting Insights:
Correlation between subjects
Clusters of high/low performers
Detected anomalies (outliers)
ðŸ“Š Visuals
Scatter plots to observe relationships
Box plots to detect outliers
Heatmap to check feature correlations
Pairplot for cluster visualization
